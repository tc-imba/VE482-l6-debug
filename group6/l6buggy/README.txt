Type "make". If Makefile fails, do as follows.
Type "gcc command.c dlist.c dlist.h opt.c opt.h -o lab6"

Run the program by typing "./lab6 sortingtype_datatype.txt targetsortingtype"
sortingtype and targetsorting type should be rand, inc, or dec.
datatype should be char, int, or double.

Three files are provided for testing, rand_int.txt, rand_char.txt, rand_double.txt. The result is output to the standard output.

To check memory leak, please use "valgrind"
